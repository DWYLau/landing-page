The Odin Project
Landing Page

The aim of this project is to make a webpage using flexbox knowledge.
In this project, I will display flexbox skills such as the ability to center items,
spread items using both the main axis and cross axis.

After finishing this project, my general thoughts is that is was amazingly fun.
The knowledge I got from doing the flex exercises provided me a lot of help.
To be honest, I think the flex exercises were way harder than actually creating the landing page.
Maybe I need to go back and revisit the flex exercises when I have time.
